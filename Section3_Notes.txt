# Section 3: Database

## 23) Creating the Database:

The only remaining major component we're missing now to cover the essence of a web app is the database, which is used to persist data over time.
This is important because if someone comes to your web app and does something then when they come a month later, you want 
whatever they did to still be there as that becomes part of a good user experience, if that forms part of your app design.
The databse is the only really external part in the flask tutorials we'll be doing, will need both sqlite3 installed for both 
python and system.
On windows, it comes pre-installed with python, however it'll need to be installed for the system, and the easiest way
to do this is to run the command prompt as admin, and the run the following command:
    "winget install sqlite.sqlite"
Accept the terms of use, them restart the code editor once the install is completed.
The first thing we'll need to do is create the sqlite database, to do this, we'll run the following command:
    "sqlite3 data.db"
where 'data.db' is the database name.
Next we'll create a table called 'users' as almost every web app will have this table and some basic columns:
    "create table users (id integer primary key autoincrement, name text, location text);"
Then once this has run, we can run the command ".tables" to verify that the table was created successfully.
Now if we insert data into the table, we should be able to see it when we do a query.
As is, if we ran:
    "select * from users;"
We'd get no response as the table is still empty.
So we'll insert some data into the table:
    "insert into users (name, location) values ('Anthony', 'Texas');"
So once the data is in, we'll see data when we run the select again.

## 24) Connect to the Database:

Note that when testing the db in the terminal, we go into sqlite3 command line, and to exit this, simply pass the command:
    ".quit"
Having created the database, we need to now connect to it in flask and use it.
The first thing to do being to "import sqlite3"
